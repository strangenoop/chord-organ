# Chord Organ

The left hand selects the chord shape, while the right hand selects the root of the chord.

Only one shape may be selected at a time, but several roots can be played together.

## Ideas

Use the number row for sampling.

Use the up/down arrows to change octave.

Hold the space bar for a delay effect.

## Songs

Nikka Costa - Everybody got their something
Air
Radiohead - Everything in it's right place, True love waits
